git push {arguments/flags} <destination url> <reference>
    the example push command we used was 'git push -u origin master'. this set of arguments says we want to update the 'master' branch under the location 'origin'
          - origin refers to the remote git repository that would need to have already been pre-defined in another command.
          - master branch is original branch name given to the example directory.
